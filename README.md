# English (intl., with AltGr dead keys)
This is a `.keylayout` file for MacOS which implements the "English (intl., with AltGr dead keys)" layout existing in Linux.

#### Features

Same as  [bteixeira's *`keylayout-en-intl-altgr-dead-keys`*](https://github.com/bteixeira/keylayout-en-intl-altgr-dead-keys) with extra glyphs when `ctrl + option` are pressed:

`ctrl + option + . [dot]` => `… [ellipsis]` 

`ctrl + option + - [minus]` => `– [ndash]`

`ctrl + option + = [equal]` => `≠ [not equal]`

`ctrl + option + / [forward slash]` => `\ [backward slash]`

#### Rationale

As a Dual Boot MacOS + Linux User with a blank keycaps keyboard (HHKB), I want the input method to be as consistent as possible.
